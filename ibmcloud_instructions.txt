1. Log into jumpserver.

2. ibmcloud login

3. ibmcloud sl vs create --datacenter=dal13 --hostname=p100 --domain=train.com --os=UBUNTU_16_64 --flavor AC1_16X120X25 --billing=hourly --san --disk=25 --disk=2000 --network 1000 --key=p305
(from week03 HW actually). it may not provision the first time if there are no
GPU resources available.

4. I did not disable password access to the VS instance intentionally. 

4. I went ahead and installed CUDA but it does not seem to be necessary, so
will skip that.

5. Install Anaconda3 (and supporting libs):
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
source ~/.bashrc
which python
conda create -n tensorflow_gpuenv tensorflow-gpu
conda activate tensorflow_gpuenv

6. May need to install various python libraries such as pandas, jupyter etc
in order to run code in zyu_data_helper_v1.ipynb.

7. From your local machine:
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8888 root@your_gpu_vs

8. Run zyu_data_helper_v1.ipynb to create train and test database.

9. setup tensorboard as in Dan's AWS instruction sheet.

10. run LineHTR code.
